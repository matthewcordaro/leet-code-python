# LeetCode Python 
These are practice problems I'm working on from [LeetCode.com](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) written in Python 3, starting with the [ðŸš€ Neet Code 150](https://neetcode.io/).

## Folder Structure
Each solution will be in a `main.py` located in a folder named to match the problem from LeetCode.com's format of: the problem number followed by its name. Also, within the folder should be a `.url` link to each problem on the website. 

These problem folders will be located in root level folders which represent the state of each problem's solution. Namely, 'finished', 'working', and 'todo'.

### Example:
```
leet-code-python
â””â”€â”€â”€finished
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€1. Two Sum
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€main.py  # This is a solution
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€TwoSum - Leet Code.url
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€217. Contains Duplicate
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€main.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€Contains Duplicate - Leet Code.url
â”‚   â””â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€â”€todo
â”‚   â””â”€ ...
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€working
    â””â”€ ...
```
