# LeetCode Python 
These are practice problems I'm working on from [LeetCode.com](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) written in Python 3.

## Folder Structure
Each solution will be in a `main.py` located in a folder named to match the problem from LeetCode.com's format of: the problem number followed by its name. Also, within the folder should be a `.url` link to each problem on the website. 

These problem folders will be located in root level folders which represent the state of each problem's solution. Namely, 'finished', 'working', and 'todo'.

### Example:
```
leet-code-python
└───finished
│   └───1. Two Sum
│   │   └───main.py  # This is a solution
│   │   └───TwoSum - Leet Code.url
│   └───217. Contains Duplicate
│   │   └───main.py
│   │   └───Contains Duplicate - Leet Code.url
│   └─ ...
└───todo
│   └─ ...
│
└───working
    └─ ...
```
